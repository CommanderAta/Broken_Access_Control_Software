# Broken Access Control Demonstration Project

This project is designed as an educational tool to demonstrate the risks and implications of broken access control vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on the unethical use of cookies to gain unauthorized access to web pages. It serves as a practical example for cybersecurity students, ethical hackers, and security professionals to understand how access control misconfigurations can be exploited and, more importantly, how to mitigate such vulnerabilities in real-world applications.

## Introduction

Broken Access Control occurs when a web application does not properly restrict access to its resources from users who are not supposed to access them. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of information, modification of data, or execution of privileged operations. In this project, we focus on how attackers can exploit cookies to bypass access controls.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a simple web application with flawed access control mechanisms. It includes examples of:

- How cookies can be manipulated to escalate privileges or impersonate other users.
- The absence of proper session management leading to unauthorized access.
- Demonstrative code snippets showing the exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

## Installation

To set up this demonstration project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourrepository/broken-access-control-demo.git
```

2. Setting Up the Environment

After cloning the repository, you need to set up your environment to run the Broken Access Control project. This involves installing the necessary dependencies and setting up a local server to test the application.

#### Requirements

- Node.js (Version 12.x or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

#### Installation Steps

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). npm is included with Node.js.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/broken-access-control


## Accessing the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can start the server and access the application through your preferred web browser.

### Starting the Server

To start the application server, navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

### Navigating the Application

After successfully accessing the application, you will be presented with the main interface, which includes various sections and functionalities. The navigation bar at the top of the page allows you to move between different parts of the application. Below, we outline the key areas you should familiarize yourself with:

#### Dashboard

The Dashboard is the central hub of the application, providing a quick overview of your activities, recent updates, and shortcuts to frequently used features. It's designed to give you immediate access to the information and tools you need.

#### User Profiles

This section allows you to view and edit user profiles. Each profile contains personal information, settings, and preferences. As part of this project, you will explore how unauthorized access to these profiles can be achieved through manipulation of cookies.

#### Settings

In the Settings area, you can customize various aspects of the application, including privacy preferences, notification settings, and account security options. This section also includes advanced settings that are typically restricted to administrators.

#### Administration Panel

The Administration Panel is a restricted area intended for use by application administrators. It includes tools for managing user accounts, setting application-wide policies, and accessing logs and reports. Unauthorized access to this panel is a key focus of this project, demonstrating the potential vulnerabilities in access control mechanisms.

### Exploiting Cookies for Unauthorized Access

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's computer by their web browser while browsing a website. They are designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information or to record the user's browsing activity. However, cookies can also be exploited to bypass authentication and authorization checks.

#### Understanding Cookie Manipulation

Cookie manipulation involves altering the cookies stored by the browser in an attempt to impersonate another user or elevate one's access level within the application. This can be achieved through various techniques, including:

- **Cookie Stealing**: Capturing a user's cookies through cross-site scripting (XSS) or other methods to gain access to their account.
- **Cookie Forging**: Creating or modifying cookies to grant oneself higher privileges or access to restricted areas of the application.

#### Practical Steps to Demonstrate Unauthorized Access

1. **Identify Cookie Vulnerabilities**: Use tools like browser developer tools or specialized software to inspect and analyze the cookies set by the application.
2. **Intercept and Modify Cookies**: Employ proxy tools to intercept HTTP requests and responses, allowing you to modify cookie values in transit.
3. **Session Hijacking**: Use captured or modified cookies to perform session hijacking, effectively taking over another user's session.
4. **Access Restricted Areas**: Attempt to access restricted areas of the application by manipulating cookie values to match those of authorized users or elevate your access level.

### Ethical Considerations

It's crucial to remember that the techniques and methods described in this project are meant for educational purposes only. Unauthorized access to computer systems and private data is illegal and unethical. Always obtain explicit permission before testing vulnerabilities on any system.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of robust access control mechanisms and the potential risks associated with the improper handling of cookies. By understanding these vulnerabilities, developers and security professionals can better protect against unauthorized access and ensure the privacy and security of user data.
